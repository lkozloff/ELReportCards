Development of this application has been moved from my personal
GitHub account to my employers. The unimagninative name is the same.

ELReportCards, for lack of a better name, provides an interface for
EL teachers to input grades.

As written it requires:
- JQuery and JEditable
- Simple-expand (http://github.com/redhotsly/simple-expand)
- OpenSIS (or rather, access to an OpenSIS database for pulling student names)

This is definitely still in development, there's lots of mess in here.
Beware.

Instructions for install:
- install JQuery and JEditable in to the js directory
- modify data.php to suit your setup
- profit!
